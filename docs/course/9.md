### 9.2. Example Control V-38437

Let's take a look at how we would write the InSpec control for V-38437:

```ruby
control 'SV-230502' do
  title 'The RHEL 8 file system automounter must be disabled unless required.'
  desc  "Automatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of
unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity."
  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the operating system disables the ability to automount devices.

    Check to see if automounter service is active with the following command:

    Note: If the autofs service is not installed, this requirement is not
applicable.

    $ sudo systemctl status autofs

    autofs.service - Automounts filesystems on demand
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/autofs.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the \"autofs\" status is set to \"active\" and is not documented with
the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the operating system to disable the ability to automount devices.

    Turn off the automount service with the following commands:

    $ sudo systemctl stop autofs
    $ sudo systemctl disable autofs

    If \"autofs\" is required for Network File System (NFS), it must be
documented with the ISSO.
  "

    describe "Control not applicable within a container" do
      skip "Control not applicable within a container"
    end
  else
    if package('autofs').installed?
      describe systemd_service('autofs.service') do
        it { should_not be_running }
        it { should_not be_enabled }
        it { should_not be_installed }
      end
    else
      impact 0.0
      describe 'The autofs service is not installed' do
        skip 'The autofs service is not installed, this control is Not Applicable.'
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## 8. Deeper Inspec Examples

### 8.1. rspec Explicit Subject

Here we have a inspec test that lists out it's current directory. Our original test code looks like this

```ruby
describe command('ls -al').stdout.strip do
  it { should_not be_empty }
end
```

If we would like to have a more [Explicit Subject](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/subject/explicit-subject) then we could refactor the code like this example

```ruby
describe "this is a detailed message" do
  subject { command('ls -al').stdout.strip }
  it{ should_not be_empty }
end
```

### 8.2. looping file structure

For looping through a file directory, the directory resource is not powerful enough to do that, so we are required to use the `command` resource and run a `find` or it's equivalent for your target OS. This can be very resource intensive on your target so try to be as specific as possible with your search such as the example below:

```ruby
command('find ~/* -type f -maxdepth 0 -xdev').stdout.split.each do |fname|
  describe file(fname) do
    its('owner') { should cmp 'ec2-user' }
  end
end
```
